# @shopify/cli-hydrogen

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Updated CLI prompts. It's recommended to update your version of `@shopify/cli` to `3.45.0` when updating `@shopify/cli-hydrogen`. ([#733](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/733)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  ```diff
  "dependencies": {
  -  "@shopify/cli": "3.x.x",
  +  "@shopify/cli": "3.45.0",
  }
  ```

- Added a new `shortcut` command that creates a global `h2` alias for the Hydrogen CLI: ([#679](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/679)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  ```sh
  $> npx shopify hydrogen shortcut
  ```

  After that, you can run commands using the new alias:

  ```sh
  $> h2 generate route home
  $> h2 g r home # Same as the above
  $> h2 check routes
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Add support for the Remix future flags `v2_meta`, `v2_errorBoundary` and `v2_routeConvention` to the `generate` command. If these flags are enabled in your project, the new generated files will follow the v2 conventions. ([#756](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/756)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Update virtual route to use Remix V2 route name conventions ([#792](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/792)) by [@DavidWittness](https://github.com/DavidWittness)
